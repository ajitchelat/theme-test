This site contains documentation for Azure RemoteApp. This documentation has been built using the source files forked from the Azure content repository on GitHub. Click [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content.git) to view the repository on GitHub. 
	
!!! danger "Important"
	Links to topics that are not part of the Azure RemoteApp documentation will not work in this build.
!!! tip "Note"
	[AZURE.IMPORTANT], [AZURE.NOTE] and [AZURE.TIP] are syntaxes used by Azure for note texts and admonitions. These syntaxes are theme-specific and will not render admonitions correctly.
